# Incomplete Information Goofspiel
 - each player has a deck of cards with values 0..N-1
 - there is a sorted deck of public cards 1..N (1 is on top)
 - at each turn players privately bid one of their cards on the current public card
 - higher bid wins the card which is then removed from the public deck and both bet cards are discarded
 - if both players bet the same amount then nobody gets the public card
 - at the end the player with higher sum of public card values wins the game (+1/-1)
 - otherwise it's a tie
